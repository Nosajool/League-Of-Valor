**Champions Table, gives stats about each champion**
* id int (by creation date) index
* champ_name string - be careful of special characters
* health int
* attack_damage int
* ability_power int
* armor int
* magic_resist int
* range int
* A support stat
* role string Marksman/Mage/Support/Assasin/Fighter/Tank will limit the amount you can have in a team (max of 2 per role?)
* catch_rate int (Make this somewhat dependant on the current IP costs with 6300's being very difficult to catch) [Variation of this](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Catch_rate)
All of these stats will be adjusted depending on the meta
Sprites will be based on the champion id
experience will be generated by the champion's level

**Pros Table**
* id int
* proname
* Team
* AD
* AP
* Armor
* Magic Resist
* Support stat
* table_champion_id: int
The pros will be somewhat the equivalent of items in vion genesis. Where you can equipt spirit of HotshotGG to nidalee
All of these statistic boosts will be % increases to the stats
Each pro has a single champion. Pros can share the same champion. This is why different stat boosts will actually be different

**Champions List**
* Id
* Champion Table id int (to pull the name, stats etc from) index
* Type string ie. Shiny Tryndamere, Golden Teemo etc...
* Experience Points int
* Owner ID
* Lineup Slot
Debating whether or not to include the Champion Name, Level, and Owner's name. These can all be called or calculated through queries so I don't think we need them



**Items Table**
* ID
* Name
* Buy
Selling items will be a percent of the buy cost
Sprites will be based on the ID number
Not sure what items will be used for. Maybe equipt them as well to add flat increases to base stats wheras pros and buffs are %increases

**Items List**
* ID
* Owner ID

**Buffs**
Obviously, there has to be red, blue, baron. A team can only have 1 of them. If you defeat someone, you take their buff.
There will be:
* 1xbaron buff
* 2xblue buffs
* 2xred buffs
These have to be pretty big boosts to your stats

**TODO:**
* Controller for TableChampion
* Champion Data page using bootstrap tables hover rows condensed
* Search by ID or search by username using routes
* Add range to champion table
